# Project title
This is just a template for making projects. Feel free to use.

## Usage
### Prerequisites
Just some basic stuff:
- Modern C/C++ compiler
- CMake installed

### Building the project
You can download a zip file or use git:
```bash
> mkdir ./project
> cd ./project
> git clone \
    ADD_GIT_LINK \
    project_name
> cd project_name
```

Great! Now you have the project, now you just need to build it:
```bash
> bash ./build.sh
> make
> ./proj
Hello, world!
```

Now your project should be up and running.


## External libraries
There is no need to have them installed, CMake will do it:
- Dep1
- Dep2

## TODOs
- [x] Implement hello world
- [ ] Do everything else
